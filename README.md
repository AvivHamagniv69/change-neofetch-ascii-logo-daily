## dependencies
you will need to install pillow and tkinter, it's supposed to come with python3 but for me it didn't so i will include it here just in case:
```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
```
```
pip3 install tk
```

## installation
first copy this line into your .bashrc located in your home directory at the line before ``` unset rc ```:
```
neofetch='neofetch --ascii /home/(path_to_directory_of_app)/new_logo.txt'
```

finally add ``` (any_minute_you_want) (any_hour_you_want) * * * /usr/bin/python3 /(path_to_folder_of_app)/ change-neofetch-ascii-logo-daily
/main.py size_of_ascii_logo``` to /etc/
